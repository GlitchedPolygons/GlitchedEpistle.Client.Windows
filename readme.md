# Glitched Epistle
## Windows Client

How to set up the development environment:

* Make sure you have your git SSH keys set up to authenticate with git correctly!
* Make sure you have git lfs installed and enabled (run `git lfs install` at least once on your system).
* Navigate to a directory that you consider to be the root folder for all of the Glitched Epistle projects (Client (shared code base) + Client.Windows (platform implementation) need to reside in the same folder!).
* Open the command line interface in that folder:
* * `git clone {git_remote_url_here} "GlitchedEpistle.Client"`
* * `git clone {git_remote_url_here} "GlitchedEpistle.Client.Windows"`
